Welcome to TTT2.

Before compiling, check if you have at least
 - ocaml 3.12
 - camlidl 1.05

The following programs and libraries may already be available on your machine:
 - gcc-c++ (provides g++)
 - zlib-devel 
 - glibc-static 2.12-1(if you compile static)
 - libxslt-devel
 - libxml-devel
 - pkg-config

To compile, type

 $ make

To run the tool, type
 
 $ ./ttt2 <file>

To run the tool in its competition mode, type
 
 $ ./ttt2 -s COMP -c comp.conf <file>

To generate (html) documentation, type

 $ make doc

After successful compilation you can type

 $ make clean

to clean up compiled sources.

See mk/README for a list of other available targets.

Information about the implementation of TTT2 can be found in

 $ doc/index.html

Never forget that you can also ask TTT2 itself, e.g., 

 $ ./ttt2 --help

shows a list of options and explains the strategy language,

 $ ./ttt2 --processors

gives a comprehensive list of (non)termination processors.
Furthermore most processors can explain their flags, e.g., 

 $ ./ttt2 -s 'matrix --help' <trs>

prints the flags one can specify for the matrix processor (for
internal reasons a TRS must be specified).

Yices: By default ttt2 is compiled w/o yices ($DISABLE_Yices=1).
If you want to compile the tool with it get yices 1.0.11 headers and
libs (download them from http://yices.csl.sri.com/download-old.shtml
and put them in src/logic/src/yices/XXbit/), type 

 $ make clean-logic; make DISABLE_Yices=
